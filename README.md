## Introduction
MIKROS is a service that aims to provide a wide functional set where users are able to view and track real-time statistics on any product. This service technology also has the potential to monitor traffic sources, track where users originate, and even contains the ability to predict the likelihood that any particular user would have an interest in your products based on their gaming history. MIKROS is the visualization layer that utilizes machine learning and artificial intelligence to transform massive data streams produced by industrial operations and M2M (mobile-to-mobile) technology into analytical insights. Mikros clearly explains what machine learning models are doing, conveys statistical inference and communicates the outcome to clients. The focus of Mikros is generating reports along with cleaning, organizing and managing data. This project serves as a demonstration of Mikros Service features, as well as a proof of concept and test for Mikros APIs.

## Getting Started
Referring to [MIKROS SDK README](https://github.com/TATUMGAMES/TG-MIKROS-SDK/blob/master/README.md#getting-started):
1. In order to use Mikros, clients (game developers/publishers) must go to https://developer.tatumgames.com/
2. Select a subscription plan. The options are FREE, STARTUP, ENTERPRISE
3. Register an account, and verify this account via email
4. Once inside the Mikros dashboard, the client can "create app". The process of creating an app is filling out a form that includes details such as company name, game title, description, package name (bundle id), product assets, videos, category {RPG, Puzzle, Platformer, CCG, Strategy, Other}

Once steps 1-4 is completed, the following will be generated:
1. App Game ID (auto-generated)
2. Production API Key (auto-generated)
3. QA API Key (Manual)
4. Development API Key (Manual)

## Features
There are a variety of features provided by the MIKROS service, including direct advertising campaigns, quicker mobile game development due to the out-of-box chat, achievements, leaderboard, registration/authentication, in-app-purchases and many more features.

* **B2C and B2B** -
The app has two perspectives, one representing the B2B client and the other representing the B2C client. While signed into a B2B client account you are able to create apps and then view analytics regarding the use of the apps you created. While signed into a B2C account you are able to see a list of apps created by all B2B client accounts and initialize a play session. 

* **TCoins** -
While you have an active play session, you can then purchase and spend TCoin. Your TCoin balance is managed and maintained across all apps in the Mikros ecosystem. TCoins are a virtual currency of Tatum Games. You have the ability to track TCoin purchases. This provides a single purchasable currency that can be shared and tracked universally across all mobile platforms. Your TCoin balance is managed and maintained across all apps in the Mikros ecosystem. Users can buy TCoin using any payment method that is supported by Google Wallet. See the [Google Wallet](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2651410?hl=en&visit_id=637078994149444116-2382553265&rd=2) help page for details about which payment methods are supported. If users are receiving a message stating that, "We cannot process your purchase, so your purchase has been canceled," then there could be a problem with their Google Wallet account information. Affected users must verify that their address and credit card information are correct. Users can also refer to Google Support articles on "[Error on purchases without full address](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1724953)" and "[Troubleshooting credit card declines.](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2505684)"
