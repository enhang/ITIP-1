## Introduction
MIKROS is a service that aims to provide a wide functional set where users are able to view and track real-time statistics on any product. This service technology also has the potential to monitor traffic sources, track where users originate, and even contains the ability to predict the likelihood that any particular user would have an interest in your products based on their gaming history. MIKROS is the visualization layer that utilizes machine learning and artificial intelligence to transform massive data streams produced by industrial operations and M2M (mobile-to-mobile) technology into analytical insights. Mikros clearly explains what machine learning models are doing, conveys statistical inference and communicates the outcome to clients. The focus of Mikros is generating reports along with cleaning, organizing and managing data.

## Features
There are a variety of features provided by the MIKROS service,

* **B2C and B2B** -
The app has two perspectives, one representing the B2B client and the other representing the B2C client. While signed into a B2B client account you are able to create apps and then view analytics regarding the use of the apps you created. While signed into a B2C account you are able to see a list of apps created by all B2B client accounts and initialize a play session. 

* **TCoins** -
While a play session is active, TCoins can be purchased and spent. TCoins are a virtual currency of Tatum Games. Users can buy TCoins using any payment method that is supported by Google Wallet. You will obtain a TCoin balance that will be managed and maintained across all apps in the Mikros ecosystem. You also have the ability to track TCoin purchases and spending.
