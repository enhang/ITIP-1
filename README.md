# Introduction
MIKROS is a service that aims to provide a wide functional set. Users can view and track real-time statistics. MIKROS also offers the ability to monitor traffic sources, track where users come from, and even predict the likelihood any particular user would have an interest in your product based on gaming history. MIKROS is the visualization layer that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to turn massive data streams produced by industrial operations and M2M (mobile-to-mobile) technology into insights. Mikros aims at generating reports, cleaning, organizing and managing data. Mikros explains what machine learning models are doing, conveys statistical inference and communicates results to clients. This project serves as a demonstration of Mikros Service features, as well as a proof of concept and test for Mikros APIs.
