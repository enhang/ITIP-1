# Overview
MIKROS is the visualization layer that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to turn massive data streams produced by industrial operations and M2M (mobile-to-mobile) technology into insights. Mikros aims at generating reports, cleaning, organizing and managing data. Mikros explains what machine learning models are doing, conveys statistical inference and communicates results to clients.


# Features
The app has two perspectives, one representing the B2B client and the other the B2C client. While signed into a B2B client account you are able to create apps and then view analytics regarding the use of the apps you created. While signed into a B2C account you are able to see a list of apps created by all B2B client accounts and initialize a play session. While you have an active play session, you can then purchase and spend TCoin. Your TCoin balance is managed and maintained across all apps in the Mikros ecosystem.
